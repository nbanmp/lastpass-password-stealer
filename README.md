# lastpass-password-stealer

Steals lastpass passwords from sites that allow you to write to subdomains. Lastpass has autofill enabled by default, and the autofill setting is only saved for each session. Using a different browser or computer (or in some cases restarting the browser) will reenable autofill. This is why automatic autofill is bad.
